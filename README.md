# Personal NeoVim config

## Icons
Icons and other special characters are used all around the config to give nvim a prettier look, 
but your terminal also needs to be able to render the icons properly.

### Installing Icon fonts

Install one of the icon fonts listed [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). Just follow their instructions for your specific OS.
After installation is complete, don't forget to configure your terminal to start using the new font. 
Each terminal does this differently, so be sure to checkout [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/).
