# Personal NeoVim config

## Icons
Icons are used by different plugins to give nvim a prettier look. The plugin for icons is already installed with this config.
But your terminal still needs to be able to render the icon font properly.

### Installing Icon fonts

Install one of the icon fonts listed [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). Just follow their instructions for your specific OS.
After you have successfully installed it, you will have to configure your terminal to start using it. 
Any reasonable terminal should allow you to enable the new icon font only for a subset of characters (eg. non-ascii). 


## TODOS
minor:
- fix gitsigns colorscheme
major:
- autoformat (prettier)
- DAP https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap
future:
- try running LSPInstall automatically for a list of servers in packer
- add indent guide lines
