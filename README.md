# Personal NeoVim config

## Icons
Icons are used by different plugins to give nvim a prettier look. The plugin for icons is already installed with this config.
But your terminal still needs to be able to render the icon font properly.

### Installing Icon fonts

Install one of the icon fonts listed [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). Just follow their instructions for your specific OS.
After you have successfully installed it, you will have to configure your terminal to start using it. 
Any reasonable terminal should allow you to enable the new icon font only for a subset of characters (eg. non-ascii). 


## TODOS
- fix diagnostic colors
- add whichkey 
- try running LSPInstall in packer
- improve icons & colors for diagnostics
- git integration (color changed/deleted lines)
- DAP https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap
- add indent guide lines
